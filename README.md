I chose to try to highlight the mass variety of foods we would not be able to have, or not be able to have in such abundance and accessibility, without bees. The background and the honeycomb pattern are thematically relevant to bees. Hopefully, the honeycomb pattern guides your eyes to move easily through the “list” of foods. I always planned on having a question be the main text of the visual but decided that I needed some more explicit context which is why there is a short sentence at the top.

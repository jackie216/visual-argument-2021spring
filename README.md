The title of my visual argument is “Without the Bees” and it is meant to highlight the foods that rely heavily or entirely on pollination by bees for cultivation to communicate the argument for the awareness and preservation of bees. Bees are often seen as a nuisance or something unwanted because of the fact that they can sting people but they are actually integral to our ecosystems and for the mass pollination of crops all around the world. Without them, the world would struggle immensely to provide the abundance of these foods that we have such easy access to, and some, like almonds and almond milk, would simply cease to exist on a mass commercial scale. The background color, text color, honeycomb pattern, and the bees, of course, are meant to be thematically associated with this argument for the preservation of bees. And hopefully, your eyes flow across the poster along the text and along the honeycomb left to right as you recognize the foods that would be at risk without bees. The foods are vibrantly colored to stand out from the background and draw your attention.
